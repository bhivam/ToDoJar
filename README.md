## Disclaimer
This project is not yet completed, there is some implementation that I wanted to add but was not able to yet due to time contraints. This is purely a static website and as such cannot do the folowing:
- Logging in
- Signing up
- Saving your specific list

## Technologies used and how they work
- The website was made with Bootstrap 4, Jquery and HTML
  - Bootstrap is a popular css framework that allows for responseive modern web design. The highlights of this framework is the 12 column grid system and media queries.
    - Webpages are split into 12 columns where content can be insterted in a way that the number of columns it takes up is 12 in total.
    - Media queries allow you to change your styles based on some logical statement
      - The main way this is used in Bootstrap is that if you have a window or device of a certain size, you can change the arrangement of the elements.
      - This allows for website design that is flexible to many devices.
  - Jquery is a library for javascript that makes writing code much easier and makes your code less verbose.
  - HTML provides the structure for your webpage.

## Main Features
- Adding tasks to the list.
- Deleting tasks from the list.
- Choosing an item randomly to simulate picking the item from a jar.
- Crossing items out.
- The navigation bar adapts to situations when the window is too small to fit all the items in.
